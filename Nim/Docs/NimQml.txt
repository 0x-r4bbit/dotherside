Introduction
-----------
The NimQml module add Qt Qml bindings to the Nim programming language
allowing you to create new modern UI by mixing the Qml declarative syntax
and the Nim imperative language.

The NimQml is made by two components:
* The DOtherSide C++ shared library
* The NimQml Nim module

This first component implements the glue code necessary for
communicating with the Qt C++ library, the latter module wraps
the libDOtherSide exported symbols in Nim

Building
--------
At the time of writing the DOtherSide C++ library must be compiled
installed manually from source.

First clone the DOtherSide git repo
::
  git clone https://github.com/filcuc/DOtherSide

than you can proceed with the common CMake build steps

::
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

If everything goes correctly you'll have build both
the DOtherSide C++ library and the Nim examples

Installation
----------
The installation is not mandatory, in fact you could try
the built Nim example in the following way
::
  cd path/to/build/dir
  cd Nim/Examples/HelloWorld
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/libDOtherSide.so
  ./HelloWorld

Given this, you can procede with the installation of the C++ library
in the following way
::
  cd to/build/dir
  make install
or by manually copying the library in your system lib directory
::
  sudo cp build/dir/path/DOtherSide/libDOtherSide.so /usr/lib

First example: HelloWorld
----------
As usual lets start with an HelloWorld example.
Most of the NimQml projects are made by one or more nim and qml
files. Usually the .nim files contains your app logic and data
layer. The qml files contains the presentation layer and expose
the data in your nim files.

``Examples/HelloWorld/main.nim``

.. code-block:: nim
   :file: ../Examples/HelloWorld/main.nim

``Examples/HelloWorld/main.qml``

.. code-block:: qml
   :file: ../Examples/HelloWorld/main.qml

The following example shows the basic steps of each NimQml app
1. Create the QApplication for initializing the Qt runtime
2. Create the QQmlApplicationEngine and load your main .qml file
3. Call the ``exec`` proc of the QApplication instance for starting
the Qt event loop

Second example: exposing data to Qml
------------------------------------
The previous example shown you how to create a simple application
window and how to startup the Qt event loop.

Is time to explore how to pass to to Qml, but first lets see the
example code:

``Examples/SimpleData/main.nim``

.. code-block:: nim
   :file: ../Examples/SimpleData/main.nim

``Examples/SimpleData/main.qml``

.. code-block:: qml
   :file: ../Examples/SimpleData/main.qml
   
The following example shows how to expose simple data to Qml:
1. Create a QVariant and sets the its internal value. 
2. Create a property in the Qml root context with a given name.

Once a a property is set through the ``setContextProperty`` proc its available
globally in all the Qml script loaded by the current engine (see the Qt doc
for more details about engine and context)

At the time of writing the QVariant class support the following types:
* int
* string
* bool
* QObject derived classes

Third example: exposing complex data and procedures to Qml
----------------------------------------------------------
As seen by the second example simple data is fine. However most
applications need to expose complex data, functions and
update the view when something change in the data layer.
This is achieved by creating object that derives from QObject.

A QObject is made of :
1. ``Slots``: slots are function callable from the Qml engine
2. ``Signals``: signals allow the sending of events
3. ``Properties``: properties allows the passing of data to
   the Qml view and make it aware of changes in the data layer
